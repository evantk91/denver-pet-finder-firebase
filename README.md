Welcome to the Flatiron School Pet Finder App! 


PAGES: 
Home page: 
    - On the home page, you can view today's featured animal. If this animal isn't your "type", just click the image to get a new featured animal! 

    Nav bar options: 
        - New user - If you don't already have a username, create a new user here. We will just need your name and email and you're good to go!
        - Current user - This is where you can select a current user to go to their user page. 
        - Browse Available Pets - View pets in your area that are available for adoption. 
        - Colorado Shelters - Check out some local shelters to find your next best friend!

Browse Available Pets: 
    - See some local buddies in the area that are up for adoption. If you notice any that have an image missing, that is likely because they were adopted and removed from the shelter's website. Do us a favor and hit the "adopted" button so we can track the animal's status, and feel free to remove them from the page as well since they already found their forever home!

User page: 
    - This page displays favorite animals. You can add more favorites in the nav-bar, and if you need to remind yourself who each animal is just head back over to the browse page. 
    - When you are ready to adopt one of your favs, just hit the "Adopt" link and it will take you to a google maps page for the shelter that animal is in. 

Colorado Shelters: 
    - View some local shelters in your area on this page. To go to the shelter's website, just tap the image or logo for that shelter. Click on the address for directions to that location.
